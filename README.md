## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github Page.

My name is `Sheddyranking` & I am a `Data Analyst` ðŸ“Š, but that's just a title. In reality, I transform data into useful, actionable insights.
But why is that necessary? Well, the credibility and success of your business depends on the decisions you make daily.
Hence, ensuring those decisions are realistic and data-driven will position you to be successful. And my job is to do this for you.

I have done some projects that I believe will interest you, they cover areas I am particularly passionate about.

  > Text Data Analysis Project (YouTube Case Study).

  > A Sales Report Analysis Project (With SQL & Power BI)
  
  > Time Series Analysis Project ( Stock Market Case-Study)
  
  > Olympic Games Analysis Project (With SQL and Power BI)
  
  > Sale Data Analysis Project (E-commerce Case Study)
  
  > Geopatial Analysis Project (Zomata Case Study).
  
  > IPL Data Analysis Projecct (Sport Case Study)

I hope you have a good time exploring and I'll be waiting to talk to you. Cheers!
